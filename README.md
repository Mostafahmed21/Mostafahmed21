# Hi, I'm Mostafa Ahmed Mohammed Mohammed Ibrahem Zaazoa

I am a junior backend developer from Alexandria, Egypt.  
I work mainly with **Node.js, Express.js, Nest.js, and MongoDB** to build server-side applications and APIs.  
I also use **Git** for version control and **Postman** for testing APIs.  
I am passionate about learning backend architecture, databases, and writing clean, maintainable code.  
My goal is to keep improving my skills and build reliable backend systems that solve real-world problems.
